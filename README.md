# Fraud Detection in Electricity and Gas Consumption

This repository contains my ongoing work for the **[Zindi: Fraud Detection in Electricity and Gas Consumption Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/fraud-detection-in-electricity-and-gas-consumption-challenge)**.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can detect fraudulent behavior in electricity and gas consumption data. Identifying such cases helps utility companies reduce losses and improve service efficiency.

This notebook includes:
- Data exploration and cleaning  
- Feature analysis and visualization  
- Model experimentation (classification models for fraud prediction)  
- Performance evaluation  

> Note: This project is **still in progress**, and results or approaches may change as I continue improving the model.

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies
- Python  
- pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 🧠 Next Steps
- Optimize feature engineering and preprocessing steps  
- Compare model performance (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression)  
- Evaluate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
